            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>
         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Printers CASE: Humbly ſubmitted to the Conſideration of the Honourable the Houſe of COMMONS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is Humbly conceiv'd, That the Tax of One Penny upon a Half Sheet, and Two Pence upon a Sheet of every Paper and Pamphlet, is not intended as a Method for preventing <hi>Libels;</hi> becauſe a Remedy for this is Propos'd, by obliging the <hi>Bookſeller</hi> and <hi>Printer</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Paper, to ſet their <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Places of Abode</hi> to the ſaid Papers.</p>
            <p>THAT after the ſaid Duty (of about Twenty Papers of Half Sheets which come out every Week, beſides many other Occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ones) there will not Two be publiſh'd, by reaſon of this Tax; which will advance every Penny Paper to Three Pence, or Two Pence Halfpenny at leaſt, and every Pamphlet in Proportion.</p>
            <p>THAT of many Hundred <hi>Maſter-Printers</hi> and <hi>Journymen</hi> in this City, two Thirds do entirely depend upon the Printing of ſmall Papers and Pamphlets, eſpecially the latter; by which all <hi>Britain</hi> is ſupplied with Sermons, and other Tracts of Devotion, at a cheap Rate: And therefore two Thirds of the ſaid <hi>Printers,</hi> with their Families, muſt be entirely Ruin'd.</p>
            <p>THAT, with all Submiſſion, nothing will contribute more to the <hi>Spreading</hi> and <hi>Publiſhing Seditious Libels,</hi> than the ſaid Tax; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, it is to be fear'd, that many of the <hi>poorer Printers,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their Families from Starving, will be tempted to Print whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall be offer'd them, by any Perſon who will be at the Charge of the Impreſſion, tho' at never ſo great a Hazard.</p>
            <p>THAT the intended Tax upon Paper (which to the Buyer will amount to near 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi>) is apprehended to be a <hi>ſufficient Load</hi> upon the <hi>Printers,</hi> and perhaps equal to that upon any other Trade.</p>
            <p>THAT Paper, after it is Printed, is of no intrinſick Value at all, but depends merely upon the Humour and Opinion of People; and that there are few Printers in this Town, who have not many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Copies by them, which they daily ſell for waſte Paper.</p>
            <p>THAT the <hi>Printers</hi> are heartily diſpoſed to correct all <hi>Abuſes</hi> in their Trade; and have herewith annex'd their humble PROPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SALS to that End, to this HONOURABLE HOUSE; which they doubt not will prove the moſt effectual Means, for preventing the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of all Seditious Libels and Pamphlets.</hi>

And on the other hand, ſome very good Books will be leſſened in the Eſteem of many Readers, through a Prejudice to its</hi> AUTHOR, <hi>both which will be very prejudicial to them, and they hope your</hi> HONOURS <hi>will not think it neceſſary to be inſiſted on. Nor are they without Grounds enclined to believe that your</hi> HONOURS <hi>will pleaſe to deſiſt from further loading them with the intended Duty of Stamps on all Pamphlets, when you ſhall be ſatisfied it can by no Means raiſe any Advantage to the</hi> CROWN, <hi>but only ſuppreſs the Printing of all ſuch ſmall Tracts; many of which if Printed and Sold at a reaſonable Price, might be of great uſe to the Publick.</hi>
